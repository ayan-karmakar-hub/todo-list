/********** Summary ***********/

For this project, I created a simple To-Do list. It consists of
an overview page that displays every task the user still has to 
complete, and a details page that lets the user create and save
a description for an individual task.

/******** Relevant Files *********/

index.html: Basic html skeleton code.

styles.css: The css file that contains all styling done to the HTML.

index.js: Contains the code for creating the overview page with 
the overall task list, as well as the code for adding and 
removing items from the list.

details.js: Contains all the code for creating the display page and
saving any changes made to the specific task's description by the user.
